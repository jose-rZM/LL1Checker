# LL1Checker
Check if the grammar is LL1; also, accept an input string and verify if that string belongs to the language generated by the grammar.
The program reads the grammar from a file.
# Compiling
A Makefile is provided.

# Requirements
- This program only works on Linux systems (for now). This is due to the use of dlfcn.h header for loading dynamic libraries.
- Lex needs to be installed on your system.
- Within the code, there is a call to the C compiler 'gcc', so, gcc needs to be installed.

# To consider
- The code assumes that the grammar file is named "input.txt" at the moment.
- The program also checks if a string belongs to the language, that string is in "text.txt".
- The end of line character is "$", currently it cannot be changed.
- Follow the structure of the provided "input.txt" when writing your grammar.
- When writing the terminals symbols, it should be noted that they will be evaluated in order. So, if A and B are two regex with common elements, you should put the more specific one first. Example:
`while { return 1; }
[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z]* { return 2; }`
