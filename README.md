# LL1Checker
Check if the grammar is LL1; also, accept an input string and verify if that string belongs to the language generated by the grammar.
The program reads the grammar from a file or standard input (by default it reads from a file).
# Compiling
A Makefile is provided.
# To consider
- The code assumes that the grammar file is named "input.txt".
- The program also checks if a string belongs to the language, that string is in "text.txt".
- The end of line character is "$", currently it cannot be changed.
- The lexer is very primitive, I have to improve it.
- Follow the structure of the provided "input.txt" when writing your grammar.
